## Description 
This is a website about SEO, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing

- My motivation to create this website was to better understand semantic HTML and how to properly condens CSS and make it easy to read
- I have built this project to develop my skills and understanding of how to deploy a website and make it public
- The problem that it solves might not be to a big public, but in its simplicity it solves my personal doubts about my understanding and skills that I have and the ones that I can further develop
- I have learnt that it is important to have the index.html and the style.css work together, that it is important to create a page with mostly semantic tags and that I can have multiple selectors in the CSS without breaking it, which makes it easier to read and keeps the code lines to a minimum.
